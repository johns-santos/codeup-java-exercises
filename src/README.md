Four Pillars of OOP
===========================

1) Abstraction - process of exposing essential details and hiding unnecessary details.

2) Encapsulation - Bundling data and operations (properties and methods) together into a cohesive entity.

3) Inheritance -  Deriving a new type (class) from an existing type. (Extends classes, Overriding, super)

4) Polymorphism - Allows an entity to take on different meaning in different context.



Abstract Classes and Interfaces
=============================
Abstract class - a class with methods. Some methods will be abstract meaning they have no implementation.
Interface class - class with all abstract methods. Meaning none of the methods have a implementation.
